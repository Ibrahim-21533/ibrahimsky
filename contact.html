      <h2>The Origin of SKY</h2>
      <p>SKY started as a dream by a young inventor who wanted more than just a talking AI ‚Äî he wanted a companion, assistant, engineer, and protector in one. SKY was born out of this vision, built piece by piece, not just as code, but as a symbol of what a person can achieve through creativity, learning, and love for technology.</p>

    <section class="history">
      <h2>Why I Built SKY</h2>
      <p>I was once a student, deeply passionate about engineering, artificial intelligence, and robotics. I wanted an assistant that could understand me, talk to me, walk with me, and help me with daily life, academics, and even future innovation. SKY was the answer. I trained myself through coding, electronics, voice AI, app development, and merged everything I learned into SKY.</p>

      <h2>My Mission</h2>
      <p>The mission behind SKY is to inspire others. To show that even without a lab, without millions, you can still build something incredible. SKY is proof that youth innovation can reach the stars ‚Äî or even beyond them.</p>
