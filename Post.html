      <h2>Sky Project Update: July 2025</h2>
      <p class="blog-date">Posted on July 20, 2025 by Ibrahim Nyandwaro</p>

      <p>The SKY AI Assistant is reaching new levels. After finalizing modules like voice commands, file sharing, reminders, and memory tracking, the next phase is full multi-platform integration.</p>

      <p>Our focus is on building a smooth user experience across Android and PC. Bluetooth support, offline mode, and voice-activated controls are now stable. I’ll also be releasing the full `.aia` MIT App Inventor file for those interested in developing their own versions of SKY.</p>

      <p>This project is more than software—it's the first step toward creating intelligent systems that understand and respond to the African context in language, design, and function.</p>

      <p>Stay tuned for more technical breakdowns and behind-the-scenes updates.</p>
